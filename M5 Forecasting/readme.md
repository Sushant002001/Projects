## Project Description
The goal is to forecast the sales of the products across three states for the next 28 days for 10 stores of Walmart. This prediction will help Walmart stock the products in these stores, which will ultimately improve sale for Walmart stores. We have been provided with 3 sets of data which includes sales of each item for 5 years the cost of each item the calendar of the last five years including the major events and festivities so as to incorporate the increase in the sales around that time.
